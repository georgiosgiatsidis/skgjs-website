Hi, I'm Eleftheria, a Community manager with a coding background, keen on UX research.

I'm working in the field of tech since 2017.

I like researching and getting to know how things started or how I could improve them! I like learning and sharing my knowledge about development/research/design and visual arts. I try to promote those things with videos and articles.

My hobbies include travelling and working out.
