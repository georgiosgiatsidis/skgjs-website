With two decades of experience spanning established tech companies, research institutions, and startups, I am dedicated to empowering frontend engineers to thrive in the ever-evolving tech landscape. As the founder of Philomath, a frontend engineering academy, I focus on providing high-quality, framework-agnostic training that not only addresses current industry needs but also prepares engineers for future growth. ￼ ￼

My mission is to share knowledge in a way that transforms lives, just as it transformed mine. Through mentoring, I have witnessed the unique journeys of engineers and aim to build strong, framework-agnostic foundations while deepening React expertise with practical, real-world applications.

In today’s AI-driven landscape, I emphasize the importance of strong fundamentals that enable engineers to effectively evaluate, customize, and debug AI-generated code, navigate emerging challenges, and adapt to rapid technological changes with confidence.

Whether you’re an engineer seeking to unlock your potential or an employer looking for skilled talent to grow your team, I am here to help you succeed.

I live in Greece (originally from Thessaloniki), and previously worked in Switzerland. I collaborate with developers worldwide — with a strong focus on the US, UK, and European markets.
