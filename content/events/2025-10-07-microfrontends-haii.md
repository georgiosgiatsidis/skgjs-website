**Talk 1: Microfrontends in Practice**
Speaker: Alexandros Tsichouridis, Senior Software Engineer @ Deloitte

Explore what problems microfrontends solve and what to consider before adopting this approach. Deep dive into three main approaches:

- Module Federation
- Single-SPA
- Web Components

Real-world experiences: when microfrontends work well, when they don't, and how to decide if they're right for your team.

**Talk 2: Human-AI Interaction (HAII)**
Speaker: Eleftheria Batsou, Developer Community @ cosine.sh

Designing interactions with AI isn't the same as designing a button or a form. Unlike traditional HCI, Human-AI Interaction is probabilistic, dynamic, and sometimes unpredictable.

Topics covered:

- Key differences between HCI and HAII
- Challenges of building AI-powered products: explainability, trust, and user control
- Real-world examples from Gemini and cosine.sh
- Practical takeaways for building AI features
