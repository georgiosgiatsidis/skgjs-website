Hey folks!

Here we go again,

The time for our 1st Meetup for the Academic Year 2025/26 and the 5th overall is just around the corner.

Time to catch-up with both familiar and new faces. We are happy to announce that it will take place on October 7, at 19.00 sharp at OKThess.

Our agenda is once again packed with two interesting talks.
