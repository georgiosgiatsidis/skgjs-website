  - title: 'Bridging Web2 and Web3: Interact with Smart Wallets in React Applications'
    description: 'Web3 often feels like a steep learning curve involving Solidity and smart contracts. This talk demonstrates how to enable a standard React application to interact directly with the blockchain using TypeScript, Wagmi, and Viem, no smart contracts required.'

  - title: 'Predictive Streaming UIs with local LLMs: Impact on React State'
    description: 'Modern user interfaces are evolving beyond simple request-and-response interactions. In this talk, we’ll build predictive streaming UIs in React powered by local LLMs using Ollama and a Llama model. Instead of relying on loading spinners, the UI progressively reveals intermediate steps in real time.'
