**Talk 1: Thinking Beyond Core Web Vitals**
Speaker: Katerina Patticha, Senior Frontend Engineer @ Elastic

Speaker: John Kapantzakis, Senior Frontend Developer @ Netdata

React 19 introduces a range of new features designed to enhance performance, improve developer experience, and simplify common workflows. A high-level look at the most important updates with practical examples.
