We’re teaming up with multiple software-focused tech communities across town for a united meetup, bringing together developers, engineers, product people, data folks, and tech leads — all working in the software industry.

This won’t be a passive event.
No slide decks. No buzzwords.

We’ll run a round-table with an open, opinionated discussion, tackling questions like:

• Is AI actually replacing software jobs — or just exposing weak skill sets?
• Are junior roles at risk? What about seniors?
• Will AI make developers 10x… or obsolete?
• How should people in the software industry adapt right now?

Expect strong opinions, different perspectives, and respectful disagreement. Everyone is encouraged to speak — whether you’re bullish on AI, deeply skeptical, or somewhere in between.

After the debate, we’ll cool things down with networking, pizza, and beer 🍕🍺 — because the best arguments usually continue over food and drinks.
