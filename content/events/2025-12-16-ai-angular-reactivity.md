**Talk 1: Angular: Build with AI**
Speaker: Konstantinos Ziazios, Microsoft

AI is rapidly transforming how developers build modern applications. Learn how Angular developers can develop faster and more efficiently using AI:

- Angular-focused LLM prompts
- Setting up an AI-powered IDE workflow
- Design patterns and best practices for AI-assisted development

**Talk 2: Virtual DOM vs Signals: Two Roads to Reactivity**
Speaker: Savvas Papageorgiadis, WeAre8

Reactivity is central to every modern UI framework, but how that reactivity is achieved differs greatly. Deep dive into two leading paradigms:

- Virtual DOM diffing (React)
- Fine-grained signals (Solid.js)

Topics covered:

- How each model handles state and updates
- Performance trade-offs
- How the React Compiler optimizes React's model
- Why mixing these paradigms introduces complexity
